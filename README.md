# Explore-Weather-Trends
## Summary
In this project, the goal is to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.
## Design
1- Extract the data from the database.<br/>
* Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.<br/>
* Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.<br/>
2- Open up the CSV by Execl.<br/>
3- Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. <br/>
4- Make observations: the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends, etc.
